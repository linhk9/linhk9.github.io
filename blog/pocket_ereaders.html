        <em>intro—</em>being a tech enthusient, who heappens to enjoy reading, I constantly find myself scouring internet forums for information regarding the newest ereader tech, it's one of my favorite consumer categories. the idea is that it will maximize the reading experience through sheer convenience, outstanding functionality, and strong flexibiltiy. having a yearly goal of 52 books, the easiser it is to read, the likelier it'll be that I complete my lofty goal. further, being someone who doesn't carry a smartphone often, I strive to live intentionality and find that raeding is one of my favorite intentional acitives. the idea of a pocket ereader woos me wit the promise to fulfill all these desires. <br>

         thus the hunt began, starting with my first device the InkPalm 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>hardware</em>—the device is well-engeineered and stoutly built. it's built with intetion, the hardware design is timeless. it's handsome and free of quirks,

    <p>
        <em>conclusions, and reccomendations</em>
    </p>
</p>

<h3>apps that I use regularly—</h3>
<ul>
    <li>aio launcher: my favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>unlauncher: my second favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>mAbook: fantastic audiobook player, unfortunately you have to install a cracked apk as purchasing the full version requires google play services</li>
    <li>anki: i enjoy studying japanese and reviewing decks on my android devices</li>
    <li>syncthing: useful for automatically syncing files between my computers and android devices</li>
    <li>tachiyomi: great manga reading app</li>
    <li>moon+ reader pro: pretty solid android e-reader app. not optimized for e-ink but works well enough. I've also tested koreader, which is optimized for eink, but find the interface displeasing. technically it's a more powerful app, and it's also open source—I should probably switch to koreader.</li>
    <li>spotify: works as expected, interface is dark but usable</li>
 </ul>
